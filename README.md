# Weather-Dashboard-ch06
#### A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and has dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

### Motivation to create this Web-App was a wish to have a convenient access to the Weather Forcast with different functionality. Which could be very usefull when planning a trip.

### This project was built because it solves a problem (get a Weather Forcast Data) which is needed for a lot of websites to be solved. So this project is a good practice and presentation of one of the ways how to do it.

### This Web-App solves such kinds of problems:
- a convenient access to the Weather Forcast;
- clean inteface;
- a search history of a list 8 cities and ability to click on then to get an updated info anytime.

### This project was interesting and usefull for me because, as a begginer, I learned:
- basics of Local Storage;
- trained my CSS skills;
- learned how to manadge style using JavaScript;
- learned how to get data from featch request;
- how to listern to multiplay targets (when user my click on one of many targets).
  
### This project may be not a unique for the World, but It is for me. It is shows that I can solved the problem that is widely requested in mordern life.
